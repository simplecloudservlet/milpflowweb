16/11/2021:	Minor changes

13/10/2021:	Load file. topology.json has all fields
                to create sX-runtime.json, but it is hard to parse it.
		We define a template to create both: topology.json and sX-runtime.json,
		 topology.json has necessary data, but embedded fields to create sX-runtime.json.
		 topology.json has unnecessary fields to describe switches.
		 template.json follows a Facade design pattern.
06/10/2021:	First personalized topology with MILPFlow
15/09/2021:	topology.txt works.

14/09/2021:	TODO: Arraylist

		batch completed (click twice in Web Interface to run)
